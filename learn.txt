- needs:
    - uniform distibution
    - minimal rehashing on resizing
    - scale horizontally

- map keys -> servers and redistibute them minimally on adding or removing server(s)
- hash ring = sorted slice

- creat a unique type has ring with a custom sort interface(like those used in heap impl.)
- use checksum hashes(hash/crc32)

Note to self: remember to dereference when mutating the slice. if not, append and slice ops are gonna be on a copy of our hash slice
